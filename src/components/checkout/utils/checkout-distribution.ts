/**
 * Determines the shopper's current delivery shipment preferences for a single shipment checkout flow.
 *
 * This function assumes there is only one shipment (shipments[0]) and that all product items
 * belong to it. It analyzes the basket to determine:
 * - Whether there are delivery items but no valid shipping address (using isAddressEmpty)
 * - Whether the first shipment exists but has no items assigned
 *
 * Empty addresses are detected using {@link isAddressEmpty}, which checks if an address
 * has meaningful content (not just null/undefined, but also empty address fields).
 *
 * @param basket - The shopping basket containing shipments and product items
 * @returns Object containing flags for delivery distribution:
 *   - `hasUnaddressedDeliveryItems`: `true` if there are product items but the first shipment
 *     has no valid shipping address (empty or missing)
 *   - `needsShippingMethods`: `true` if the first shipment exists, has items, and has a falsey shippingMethod
 *   - `hasEmptyShipments`: `true` if the first shipment exists but there are no product items
 *   - `deliveryShipments`: Array containing the first shipment if it exists and has items
 *     (address can be empty), otherwise an empty array
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const basket = (await getBasket(context)).current;
 * const distribution = getSingleShipmentDistribution(basket);
 *
 * if (distribution.hasUnaddressedDeliveryItems) {
 *   // Show address form - items exist but no valid address
 * } else if (distribution.deliveryShipments.length > 0) {
