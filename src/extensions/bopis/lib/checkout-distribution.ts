/**
 * Determines the shopper's current pickup and delivery shipment preferences,
 * especially for the purpose of determining the proper checkout flow.
 *
 * This function analyzes the basket's shipments and product items to determine:
 * - Whether there are any pickup items (items in shipments with c_fromStoreId)
 * - Whether there are any delivery items (items in shipments without c_fromStoreId)
 * - Whether there are more than one delivery items (enables multi-address checkout)
 * - Whether there are multiple unique delivery addresses
 *
 * Empty shipments (shipments with no assigned items) are always excluded from all
 * distribution flags except `hasEmptyShipments`. This ensures that empty shipments
 * do not affect pickup/delivery calculations or address checks.
 *
 * @param basket - The shopping basket containing shipments and product items
 * @returns Object containing flags for pickup/delivery distribution:
 *   - hasPickupItems: true if there are any items in pickup shipments
 *   - hasDeliveryItems: true if there are any items in delivery shipments
 *   - enableMultiAddress: true if there are more than one delivery items (deliveryItemCount > 1)
 *   - hasMultipleDeliveryAddresses: true if there are more than one unique delivery addresses
 *   - hasUnaddressedDeliveryItems: true if there are delivery shipments with items but no shipping address
 *   - needsShippingMethods: true if any non-empty delivery shipment has a falsey shippingMethod
 *   - hasEmptyShipments: true if there are any shipments with no items assigned
 *   - isDeliveryProductItem: function that returns true if the supplied item is in a delivery shipment
 *   - deliveryShipments: array of non-empty delivery shipments (shipments without c_fromStoreId)
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const basket = (await getBasket(context)).current;
 * const distribution = getPickupShipmentDistribution(basket);
 *
 * if (distribution.hasPickupItems && distribution.hasDeliveryItems) {
 *   // Mixed basket - show combined checkout flow
 * } else if (distribution.hasPickupItems) {
 *   // Pickup only - show pickup checkout flow
 * } else if (distribution.hasMultipleDeliveryAddresses) {
 *   // Multiple addresses - show multiship checkout flow
 * } else {
 *   // Single delivery - show standard checkout flow
 * }
