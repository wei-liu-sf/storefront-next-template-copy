 * Extracts pickup items from basket by checking shipments for store pickup.
 *
 * For items to be marked as pickup:
 * 1. The basket must have a shipment with c_fromStoreId set (indicating store pickup)
 * 2. Product items in that shipment must have an inventoryId
 *
 * Note: When c_fromStoreId is set on a shipment, all items in that shipment are
 * pickup items from that store. The inventoryId on product items will be the
 * store's inventory ID (not the site's global inventory).
 *
 * @param basket - The shopping basket containing shipments and product items
 * @returns Map of productId to PickupItemInfo (inventoryId and storeId)
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Get basket from context
 * const basket = (await getBasket(context)).current;
 *
 * // Extract pickup items from basket
 * const pickupItems = getPickupItemsFromBasket(basket);
 *
 * // Check if a specific product is for pickup
 * const productId = 'product-123';
 * if (pickupItems.has(productId)) {
 *   const pickupInfo = pickupItems.get(productId);
 *   console.log(`Product ${productId} will be picked up from store ${pickupInfo?.storeId}`);

 *
 * // Iterate through all pickup items
 * for (const [productId, { inventoryId, storeId }] of pickupItems) {
 *   console.log(`Product ${productId}: inventory ${inventoryId}, store ${storeId}`);
