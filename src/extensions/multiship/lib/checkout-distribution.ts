/**
 * Determines the shopper's current delivery shipment preferences,
 * especially for the purpose of determining the proper checkout flow.
 *
 * This function analyzes the basket's shipments and product items to determine:
 * - Whether there are more than one product items (enables multi-address checkout)
 * - Whether there are more than one unique delivery addresses
 * - Whether there are delivery shipments with items but no shipping address
 * - Whether there are any shipments with no items assigned
 *
 * Empty shipments (shipments with no assigned items) are always excluded from all
 * distribution flags except `hasEmptyShipments`. This ensures that empty shipments
 * do not affect address checks.
 *
 * @param basket - The shopping basket containing shipments and product items
 * @returns Object containing flags for delivery distribution:
 *   - enableMultiAddress: true if there are more than one product items (productItems.length > 1)
 *   - hasMultipleDeliveryAddresses: true if there are more than one unique delivery addresses
 *   - hasUnaddressedDeliveryItems: true if there are delivery shipments with items but no shipping address
 *   - needsShippingMethods: true if any non-empty delivery shipment has a falsey shippingMethod
 *   - hasEmptyShipments: true if there are any shipments with no items assigned
 *   - deliveryShipments: array of non-empty delivery shipments
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const basket = (await getBasket(context)).current;
 * const distribution = getMultiShipmentDistribution(basket);
 *
 * if (distribution.hasMultipleDeliveryAddresses) {
 *   // Multiple addresses - show multiship checkout flow
 * } else {
 *   // Single delivery - show standard checkout flow
 * }
