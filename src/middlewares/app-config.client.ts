 * Client middleware to ensure app config is in context before other middleware runs
 *
 * Reads config from window.__APP_CONFIG__ (injected by server from process.env during SSR).
 * This ensures 12-factor compliance: config comes from environment, not baked into bundle.
 *
 * Note: root.tsx also provides config via <ConfigProvider> for the initial render cycle.
 * This middleware ensures it's available in router context for loaders/actions on client navigations.
 *
 * ⚠️ Client middleware runs AFTER initial render. To access config before this middleware:
 * 1. Use window.__APP_CONFIG__ directly
 * 2. Use useConfig() hook (React Context)
 * 3. Set router context earlier in root.tsx
